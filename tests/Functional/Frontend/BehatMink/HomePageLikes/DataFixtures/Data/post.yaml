            A random guy which loves to blame everyone came to support his point. I was like "yeah go for it, life's good" anyway. For unknown reasons an another guy went into corpse elimination, they quickly calmed down when I started explaining everything I knew. I'm a fun guy I swear.
            Restored disk didn't work, so I took a look on the BSOD error and, for once, I found an answer: wrong bios config for reading the disk. Had to change something I don't remember, so the old disk was fine. I claimed it has dead anyway, no one would care. It came back to life.
